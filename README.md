# Titanic Survival Prediction model using ML
Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction repository! This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the survival chances of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, passenger class, and more
Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction project is a classic machine learning task that aims to classify whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not. By analyzing the dataset and building predictive models, this project helps demonstrate the application of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning in real-world problems.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers such as:

Passenger ID
Age
Gender
Ticket Class (Pclass)
Embarked Port
Fare
Number of Siblings/Spouses aboard
Number of Parents/Children aboard
Survival (Target variable: 0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)
Features
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights into data distribution and feature importance using visualization.
Feature Engineering: Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical data.
Model Building: Training machine learning models to predict survival.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.
